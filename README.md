## Goal

The objective of making this app is to learn the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps I build in the future. This app tought how to make apps with functionality using setState() inside Stateful Flutter widgets.

This is a Las Vegas dice app. You can make the die roll at the press of a button. With this app in your pocket, youâ€™ll be able to settle any score on the go!

## What I learnt

- How to use Flutter stateless widgets to design the user interface.
- How to use Flutter stateful widgets to update the user interface.
